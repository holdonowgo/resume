      summary: `Lead an OpenShift Engineering team's people and strategy, growing a small ad-hoc group into a 12 person cross-functional team. Our component bridges the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Container Operator System (RHCOS) with Red Hat's Kubernetes application platform (OpenShift).
 
      The teamâ€™s stability wins transformed releases from a last-minute nailbiter to a routine event. The team's flexibility and future-thinking design unblocked our customer pipeline and empowered engineers to code less, engineer more.

      Was lead engineer in the development of in-house customer suppport tooling, responsible for architecture, and implementation. I was also responsible for the team's people strategy, hiring, and mentoring.

      The tooling features include: user account activity monitoring with notifications of misbehavior on the platform.  Monitored activity includes direct and community messaging within the app, job application and interview activity.

      The tooling also includes a customer support dashboard, which allows support engineers to view and manage member and customer accounts, and multiple bulk actions to support the customer support team such as account deactivation, account reactivation, and account deletion.

      The tooling is built on a Vue/Vuex frontend with TypeScript, and communicates with multiple Node.js microservices as well as an OpenJPA Java application. The web app is deployed on S3.

      The features transformed customer account triage and policing of ToS violations from being multi-step operations across multiple dashboards to a single routine event with the tooling 
      allowing bulk customer onboarding, store admin account creation/deletion and job posting creation/deletion/update.  This resulted in a 10x improvement in customer support efficiency, and a 5x improvement in customer satisfaction.

      Worked directly with our Support Team to develop a customer support dashboard, which allows support engineers to view and manage member and customer accounts, and multiple bulk actions to support the customer support team such as account deactivation, account reactivation, and account deletion.

      Documentation is kept in a Notion wiki, and is updated as needed.  The documentation is used by the team to onboard new members, and to provide a reference for the team's processes and procedures.
